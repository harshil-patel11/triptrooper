# Trip Trooper

Travelers face challenges with planning and managing their trips amidst their busy schedules.

Trip Trooper aims to alleviate the problems associated with searching for places of interest while traveling. The app allows travelers to find and save places of interest and add these to their own customizable lists, for later viewing.

Additionally, travel groups can utilize the group feature to join groups and collectively browse and maintain place lists. The highlight of the app is that lists can be optimized based on the shortest distance needed to cover all the places in them thereby enhancing the userâ€™s traveling experience.
